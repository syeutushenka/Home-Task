Fear hits like a drug in the veins
Hard to stop like a runaway train
Look around, but there's nobody to blame
Oh, what a shame
Spending nights just staring at the wall
Pay no mind to the demons in the hall
Yeah, I'm numb, I don't feel nothing at all
Braced for the fall
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?
Manic
Manic
It's a war, but I'm never on attack
Holding on, but I'm slippin' through the cracks
Don't wanna be another body in the stack
Never coming back
Spending nights just staring at the wall
Pay no mind to the demons in the hall
Yeah, I'm numb, I don't feel nothing at all
Braced for the fall
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?
Manic
Manic
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?
Manic
Out of body, out of mind
Tellin' everyone I'm fine, but I'm sellin' 'em a lie
Out of body, out of mind
Think I'm running out of time
Oh God
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
Die
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?
Manic
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down, but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?
Manic
